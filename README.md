# Data Scraper Belgian Locations
 Belgian Zipcode City Sub-Municipality and Province Dataset + Potential Scraper if more information gets added.


## About

The dataset included has been manually appended by me to include all post codes(zip codes) used in a different dataset. This may still not be the complete list, but it covers a wide range already (tested on a dataset with over 10k entries).


## Usage

The 'analysis.py' file includes a scraper for the website I found [here](https://www.metatopos.eu/belgcombiN.html). It collects zip codes, city-names, sub-municipalities and province for locations within Belgium.
